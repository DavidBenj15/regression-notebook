# ðŸ“ˆ Regression Notebook: EN.601.464 Artificial Intelligence Final Project
**By David Benjamin**

This repository contains an interactive exercise designed to help students learn about **Linear and Polynomial Regression**. Students will implement core components from scratch, including loss computation, gradient descent, and prediction functions.

They will begin by training a linear regression model to predict housing prices using a single feature of their choice.
Next, they will extend their model to use all six features available in the dataset.
Finally, students will explore Polynomial Regression, building predictors that incorporate higher-degree terms.

Throughout the project, students will investigate how increasing the polynomial degree affects model performance,
fit curves to their data, and provide a brief write-up summarizing their findings.
